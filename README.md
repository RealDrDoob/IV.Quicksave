Actual QuickSave script for GTA IV.

Default key is F5, but it can be changed in the ini.

Pressing Alt and the hotkey will show the save menu, like traditional quicksave mods.

**CAUTION: This will overwrite your last autosave, and will likely not work if autosaving is disabled.**

Requirements:
- [Any ASI loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader)
- [GTA 4 Scripthook](http://www.dev-c.com/gtaiv/scripthook/)
- [GTA 4 ScriptHookDotNet](http://hazardx.com/files/gta4_net_scripthook-83)
